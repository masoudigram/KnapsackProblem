# Knapsack Problem

## Overview
This project explores the Knapsack Problem, a classic optimization problem in computer science and mathematics. The goal of the problem is to determine the most valuable combination of items to include in a knapsack without exceeding its weight capacity. This notebook provides an in-depth analysis and implementation of algorithms to solve the Knapsack Problem.

## Features
- Explanation of the Knapsack Problem.
- Implementation of various algorithms to solve the problem, including:
  - Dynamic Programming
  - Greedy Algorithms
  - Brute Force
- Visualization of results and comparisons between algorithms.
- Analysis of time complexity and performance.

## File Structure
- `KnapsackProblem.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation, analysis, and visualizations.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
